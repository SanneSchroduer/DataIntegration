## Run the application
The application can be started using the following commands:

2. Build the containters:

    ```docker-compose up --build``` 

3. Start a new terminal, enter the database container and execute the python script for filling the database.

    ```docker exec -it [ID of database container] /bin/bash```
    
    ```python init_database.py```
    
4. Go back to the terminal where the containers are running and click on the link of the Flask application.
